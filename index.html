    Hi, I'm based in New York and raised in Colombia. Currently studying Emerging Media at Hunter College, and aspiring to be a UX/UI designer or product designer. Some of the tools I use often are Bazart for photo editing and Apple editing. I picked this class because I want to learn more about digital art since I mostly know non-technological traditional methods. I do not have any set expectations, but I do want to learn as much as possible from this class. Thank you for reading this :).
